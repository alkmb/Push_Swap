# Push Swap Project
- Overview:
The Push Swap project presents a sorting algorithm for arranging numbers in ascending order using two stacks. 
The method employs a two-step process: first, a simplified bubble sort is applied to initially sort the numbers, 
followed by a custom implementation of the radix sort algorithm to achieve the final sorted order. 
The sorting process involves rotations and pushes, optimizing the sorting strategy for efficiency.

## Key Features:
- Bubble Sort Initialization:

Utilizes a straightforward bubble sort to initialize an initial sorted order.
- Radix Sort Implementation:

Employs a custom implementation of the radix sort algorithm using bit-shifting and the least significant bit.
- Rotation and Push Operations:

Achieves sorting by manipulating two stacks through rotations (moving the first element to the last) and pushes (transferring elements between stacks).
